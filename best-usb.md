USB Network Gate can easily save you from having to drive all the way to your worksite and back just to get some print job done on the office printer. And your hardware key will last much longer if you share it from your machine instead of unplugging and reconnecting it every time someone else needs it.<br><br>
With USB Network Gate, you’ll never have any issues accessing your local USB peripherals during <b>RDP sessions</b>, from <b>virtual environments</b> (s.a. VMware, Citrix XenDesktop, Microsoft Hyper-V), and/or blade servers.<br><br>
On top of that, the unique <b>“Device isolation”</b> feature can make a shared device invisible for everyone, except for a specific user.<br><br>
<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of USB over Ethernet:</h3>
Pros: Secure connection protecting your sensitive data with both encryption and password.
<ul>
  <li>Works on all popular platforms and with literally any type of USB device.</li>
<li>Traffic compression to speed-up data transfers and optimize bandwidth utilization.</li>
<li>Not a free app.</li>
<li>Known issues with some exotic web-browsers (fixed in the latest version).</ul><br>
<h2>2. FlexiHub</h2><br>
<b>Platform:</b> Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android<br>
<b>Cross-connectivity:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Security:</b> 2048-bit SSL encryption<br>
<b>Traffic optimization:</b> optional compression<br>

<a href="https://flexihub.com/">FlexiHub</a> is an upper-division software solution with a powerful toolset for sharing USB devices over a network and operating remote USB devices. Unlike some other apps of this type, its license is bound to your account, and not some hardware, meaning, you can use FlexiHub on all your machines.<br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46779779/120806440-85a1e500-c54f-11eb-9bb5-f76f0a124bc9.mp4


<b>You can invite</b> other account owners to use your shared devices and won’t have to reveal your login or password to do so. FlexiHub has its own USB Redirector Server, so you can connect any remote USB over a network even if it has no public IP address and your computer can’t “see” that other PC that device is shared from.<br><br>
Also, there is a new <b>“Keep connection active”</b> option you can enable to avoid losing your data or the unsaved work-in-progress owing to some unexpected network failure. Again, unlike its competitors, FlexiHub will also work for your <b>serial devices</b>, which can come in very handy.<br>
And the latest version for Windows has <b>FlexiChat</b> where you can communicate with other users logged into your FlexiHub account in real-time.<br><br>

<b>USB over Network</b> is a great solution for redirecting USB devices to remote computers over Ethernet, Internet, or any other network. USB virtualization technology creates an exact virtual copy of a USB device shared from a server on every client’s PC. The distance won’t be the matter with this efficient app. USB over Network will let you access your valuable USB peripherals even if you are in another country or another part of the world by fully emulating the USB stack of remote USB devices and redirecting them over LAN or the Internet.<br><br>

<b>USB over Ethernet</b> is a professional-grade app capable of much more than just sharing your USB peripherals over LAN, Wi-Fi, or the Internet. With its help, you can also access a remote USB over the Internet or other network so you won’t have to physically reattach it to do so. This app is easy to install and has a very simple user-friendly interface. All the devices are shared/unshared and connected/disconnected on-the-fly.<br><br>

<a href="http://piccy.info/view3/14356622/1bb91d8e65c2f9ebd876eeb7e945a45c/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/f1c986e01a4316ce30e45e4c4ddb175d/1622813353/50137/1431936/1_Oxbbqynnvo4Gf9ywxWyYfA.png" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting" border="0" /></a><a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2021-06-04-13-29/i9-14356622/657x486-r" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.piccy.info/a3/2021-06-04-13-29/i9-14356622/657x486-r/i.gif" alt="USB over Ethernet app" border="0" /></a> <br>

USB over Ethernet has a very convenient IP Filters function that’ll help you limiting access to the shared device for certain IPs only, or banning some IPs from using your devices. Once you install the app, all new devices connected to your server’s USB ports will be automatically recognized and shared, unless you’ve added a device policy rule forbidding that. Using those rules, you can create the “Allow” and “Block” lists for certain types of peripherals. Plus, you can use the “Force Connection to…” option to attach a USB device to a remote client PC from the server-side.<br>
<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of USB over Ethernet:</h3>
<ul><li>Very simple and straightforward installation process.</li>
<li>Compatible with all popular virtual environments.</li>
<li>Auto-reconnecting after network failures.</li>
<li>For a free trial period, you can only share 1 USB device.</li>
<li>A single-computer license (you can’t use the app on any other devices).</li>
<li>Windows-only app, won’t work on any other platform.</li></ul><br><br>
<h2>5. VirtualHere</h2><br>
<b>Platform:</b> Windows, Linux, macOS, Android (server)<br>
<b>Cross-connectivity:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Security:</b> SSL traffic encryption<br>
<b>Traffic optimization:</b> No<br>

<b>VirtualHere</b> is a dedicated app for sharing USB over a network. Using VirtualHere, you can redirect USB devices over IP to your LAN, the Internet, or even the cloud to enable remote browsing of the device’s contents and access all its features without having it physically plugged into a client machine. When you buy a license, you only pay for a server-side app version. The client-side version is free, and you can install it on any number of client machines. VirtualHere USB Server is compatible with all popular platforms, but the Client will only work on Linux, Windows, and macOS.<br><br>

<li>The free version limit of one shared device only.</li><br>
<li>Hardware-bound license: you can’t use any other machine as your server.</li><br>
<li>Low-speed data transfer.</li></ul><br><br>
<h2>6. USB/IP Project</h2><br>

<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbip/">USB/IP Project</a> is a free USB over IP software application designed specifically for sharing USB peripherals over the network.
Technically speaking, the app redirects I/O messages from USB over IP, so any networked machine gets to access USB peripherals remotely and make the most of all the features it has to offer.<br><br>
<a href="http://piccy.info/view3/14356631/7473bba6507384d5b71b177eeb41df40/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/67ce63519b105ba67067f9e243c4f06c/1622813927/32985/1431936/1_YjixD5wp4wbv3Y_zr6q_Kg.png" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting" border="0" /></a><a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2021-06-04-13-38/i9-14356631/353x240-r" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.piccy.info/a3/2021-06-04-13-38/i9-14356631/353x240-r/i.gif" alt="USB/IP Design Overview" border="0" /></a><br><br>

Originally, USB/IP Project was designed for Linux and thus won’t do any good on any other operating system. However, there is a new client version that allows you to share USB over IP to a Windows machine, it’s still very much in the early stage of its creation process and hasn’t been fully tested yet.<br>

All in all, USB/IP Project is a very simplistic tool with a single function. On one hand, it’s a good thing, as you can’t possibly get confused with its setup, config, or usage. But on the other hand, there’s not much flexibility and all-purposeness is sadly out of the question.<br>
<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of USB/IP Project:</h3><br>
<ul><li>It’s a free app that won’t exhaust your financial reserves.</li><br>
<li>Confusion-free interface with a bare minimum of features.</li><br>
<li>It’s an open-source app and you’re welcome to take part in the development process.</li><br>
<li>Known issues with client installation on x64 Windows.</li><br>
<li>Won’t work on macOS or Android.</li><br>
<li>No autodetection of shared devices.</li><br></ul>
